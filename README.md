# plush

Rebuilding [SFXR][sfxr] in C++, bit by bit.

The name "plush" came from a random onomatopoeia. Other than an analogy for
"sound effect randomizer", no big meaning here.

The general idea is to pull algorithms from DrPetter's [SFXR][sfxr] in a
reusable C++ library. The focus is to generate sounds real-time instead of
exporting to WAV files.
